HTTP is the protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, i've build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.


To execute the code : 
-Open the folder in node.js and run command :

   ```sh
   node app/main.js
   ```

You can use curl to send HTTP requests from your terminal or command prompt . For example : 

  ```sh
   curl http://localhost:4221/

   ```
